											<h4 class="title">Poverty In America </h4>
											<div class="content">

									In the late 1950s, the poverty rate for all Americans was 22.4%, or 39.5 million individuals. These numbers declined steadily throughout the 1960s, reaching a low of 11.1%, or 22.9 million individuals, in 1973. Over the next decade, the poverty rate fluctuated between 11.1% and 12.6%, but it began to rise steadily again in 1980. By 1983, the number of poor individuals had risen to 35.3 million individuals, or 15.2%.	<br>
									<br>Children represent a disproportionate share of the poor in the United States[3]. They are 23% of the total population, but 31.9% of the poor population. In 2017, 12.8 million children, or 17.5%, were poor. The poverty rate for children also varies substantially by race and Hispanic origin, as shown in the table below.

													<br>
Poverty is a pervasive human condition of being unable to obtain or provide a standard level of food, water and/or shelter. It exists in every country in varying degrees, and it is unlikely to disappear anytime soon. The United States is considered the richest country in the world, and yet millions of its residents live in poverty.													<br>
													<br>
Impoverished families tend to have less education, more health problems and less access to nutritionally adequate food. They also are more likely to live in high-crime areas.And then they are to blame for the area they live in, when sometimes the real reason is that area is all they can afford. Such a great amount of the US population is labeled as "in poverty".	<br>
													<br>
													This connects to mental health issues because of the fact that people in poverty do not get the luxuries of having material items. Though living in the country where dreams are supposed to come true, many people come to find out that they may live in conditions that were worse than they were before in the home country. People in poverty tend to have low self-esteem because of all the material items they do not have.

											<h4 class="title">Poverty in Third World Countries</h4>
											<div class="content">

												<br>
												<br>
												In third world countries, the conditions are worse. These countries have less resources and their government do not really have the funding for programs or groups to help out the ones in need. In third world countries, many parents leave their children because they cannot afford to take care of them and the kids have to struggle to survive and have to work at an early age. Poverty in third world countries tend to be thrown under the rug. In places like the Phillippines, all the trash from different countries throw it down to the land.
												<br>
												<img src="img/poverty12.jpeg" style="width:400px" alt=""> <br> <h10> Image from https://www.newsclick.in</h10>
												<br>
												<br>
												Many people degrade the third world countries. In reality, these places cannot afford to pay for better housing and there aren't companies that help support or make expenses less so that families can own a place to live in. Underdeveloped countries are at the very bottom of the global economy, with widespread extreme poverty and dire living conditions. They usually have little or no infrastructure or reliable health care and other social services. Many have experienced long-term political unrest in the form of civil war or armed conflict with other nations, or have been subject to unstable governments, dictatorships, and/or corruption. In addition, they may frequently suffer environmental events and natural disasters that cause famine, destruction, and displacement of large segments of their populations.
												<br>
												<br>
												Due to poorly maintained hospitals,the UN's Human Development Report 2005, life expectancy has fallen dramatically in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa since 1990, when it saw a brief increase. This is due largely to the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) on the continent. The UN's Human Development Report 2005 estimates that, of the three million people worldwide who died of AIDS in 2004, 70% were in Africa.
													<br>
													<br>
Negative life experiences can carry an increased risk of suffering a related mental disorder for some individuals but there are studies that have shown that strength of support (family, community) can mitigate effects and that the majority of people possess enough resiliency to be able to effectively cope. There are no sure answers to the duality of resilience versus vulnerability but some possible determinants pertain to beliefs, attitudes, coping strategies, behaviors, psychosocial cohesion.
The problem becomes with the struggle of children who are left behind by their parents. So these children to think less of themselves, questioning their worth, thinking about why their parents left them, thinking they weren't good enough.
